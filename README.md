# Walmart Sales Prediction Project

## Overview
This project focuses on predicting weekly sales for Walmart stores across various departments. The dataset includes historical sales data, along with information about store attributes and holiday events. The goal is to develop a predictive model that can accurately forecast weekly sales, enabling better planning and decision-making for store operations.

## Dataset
The dataset consists of multiple CSV files containing information about Walmart stores, departments, weekly sales, and holiday events. It spans several years and includes various features such as store size, temperature, fuel price, consumer price index (CPI), and unemployment rate.

## Features
The dataset includes the following features:
- Store ID
- Department ID
- Date
- Weekly Sales
- Store Type
- Store Size
- Temperature
- Fuel Price
- CPI
- Unemployment
- Holiday Flag

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Performed comprehensive EDA to gain insights into the dataset, including:
- Distribution of weekly sales
- Trends over time
- Correlation between features
- Seasonality and holiday effects

## Data Preprocessing
Preprocessed the dataset by:
- Handling missing values
- Encoding categorical variables
- Scaling numerical features
- Handling outliers

## Feature Engineering
Engineered new features to improve model performance, such as:
- Creating lag features for time series analysis
- Encoding cyclical features (e.g., month, day of week)
- Generating interaction terms between relevant features

## Model Development
Explored various machine learning models for sales prediction, including:
- Linear Regression
- Random Forest
- Gradient Boosting
- Neural Networks

## Model Evaluation
Evaluated model performance using appropriate metrics such as:
- Mean Squared Error (MSE)
- R-squared (R2)

## Deployment
Deployed the best-performing model to production using Streamlit services.

## Conclusion
Summarized key findings and insights from the project, highlighting the importance of accurate sales prediction for Walmart's business operations.
